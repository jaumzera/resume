            <h2>Presentation</h2>
            <p>Since 1996, I have been deeply engaged in the realm of computer programming, beginning my self-taught
                journey with Clipper 5 and C/C++. As time evolved, my passion and focus shifted towards PHP development,
                and during my collegiate years, to Java EE. Following my Java EE experience, I further expanded my
                technical repertoire by diving into Spring Boot, AWS, and Kubernetes, embracing these cutting-edge
                technologies to enhance my development skillset. Additionally, my curiosity and commitment to continuous
                learning led me to explore new programming languages like Dart (specifically for Flutter) and develop a
                growing interest in Python and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Throughout the years, I've planned and executed projects across the nation for both small and large
                companies in the financial and telecom sectors. My expertise is grounded in software engineering, and I
                continuously blend this knowledge with a keen interest in code quality, design patterns, agile
                processes, open source tools, automated testing, and continuous integration. This diverse experience has
                enabled me to develop a comprehensive understanding of the industry and a versatile skill set, making me
                adept at addressing a wide range of technical challenges in today's dynamic technology landscape.</p>
